[ ] split the routes out from the main app file as per
    charlesleifer.com

[ ] Create the other models... league, league_stats, match, match_stats
    match_odds, match_probabilities

[ ] Incorporate angular, I would think retrieving the odds and whatnot
    could be used. Especially executing a task via redis.

[ ] Hell the whole page could be build using angular

[ ] what the hell is the difference between angular, react, nodejs,
    etc...
